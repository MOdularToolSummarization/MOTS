<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Black Vulture (Coragyps atratus) also known as the American Black Vulture, is a bird in the New World vulture family whose range extends from the southeastern United States to Central Chile and Uruguay in South America.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Although a common and widespread species, it has a somewhat more restricted distribution than its compatriot, the Turkey Vulture, which breeds well into Canada and south to Tierra del Fuego.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Despite the similar name and appearance, this species is unrelated to the Eurasian Black Vulture.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The latter species is an Old World vulture in the family Accipitridae (which includes eagles, hawks, kites and harriers), whereas the American species is a New World vulture.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is the only extant member of the genus Coragyps, which is in the family Cathartidae.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It inhabits relatively open areas which provide scattered forests or shrublands.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>With a wingspan of 1.5 m (5 ft) the Black Vulture is a large bird though relatively small for a vulture.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It has black plumage, a featherless, grayish-black head and neck, and a short, hooked beak.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The Black Vulture is a scavenger and feeds on carrion, but will also eat eggs or kill newborn animals.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It finds its meals either by using its keen eyesight or by following other (New World) vultures, which possess a keen sense of smell.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It lays its eggs in caves or hollow trees or on the bare ground, and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by regurgitation.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.</a>
