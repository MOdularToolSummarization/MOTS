<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The Red-winged Fairywren was officially described by ornithologist John Gould in 1837, who derived the bird's specific name derived from the Latin term elegans 'elegant'.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Red-winged Fairywren is 15 cm (6 in) long and weighs 8–11 g (0.21–0.38 oz), making it the largest of the fairywrens.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Like other fairywrens, the Red-winged Fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males adopting a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting with black and grey-brown.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Vocal communication among Red-winged Fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a social group and for advertising and defending a territory.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Within the forest habitat, the Red-winged Fairywren prefers wetter gullies and riverside Sword Sedge (Lepidosperma effusum).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for Red-winged Fairywren conservation are Araluen-Wungong, Jalbarragup, Mundaring-Kalamunda, North Dandalup, the Stirling Range, Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Hopping, with both feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously, is the usual form of locomotion, though birds may run while performing the 'Rodent Run Display' detailed below.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Major nest predators include Australian Magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds (Cracticus spp.)</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Observed in this species, the 'Wing-fluttering' display is seen in several situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male courtship displays, juveniles while begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones.</a>
