<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Joseph's style attracted the attention of Narada Productions, a Virgin Records subsidiary, via the World Wide Web.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Having experienced both avenues of recording on a major label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Joseph believes that "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words."</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For the 2002 album One Deep Breath, Joseph combines "structured melodic pieces and free-form ambient compositions", which "departs dramatically from the previous more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, Hear the Masses and Rapture".</a>
