<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Growth (1760–1830)</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Mechanization and increased production</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In 1843, the Padarn Railway become the first quarry railway to use steam locomotives, and the transport of slate by train rather than by ship was made easier when the London and North Western Railway built branches to connect Port Penrhyn and Port Dinorwic to the main line in 1852.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Mechanization was gradually introduced to make most aspects of the industry more efficient, particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north, and therefore easier to work by machine.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The bad rockmen and rubbish men were usually paid by the ton of material removed, but the quarrymen were paid according to a more complicated system.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Industrial unrest and decline (1879–1938)</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The quarries and mines made increasing use of mechanization from the start of the 20th century, with electricity replacing steam and water as a power source.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>End of large-scale production (1939–2005)</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to a severe drop in trade.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Total production of slate in Wales declined from 54,000 tons in 1958 to 22,000 tons in 1970.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Quarries still producing slate</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The Greaves Welsh Slate Company produces roofing slates and other slate products from Llechwedd, and work also continues at the Berwyn Quarry near Llangollen.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The Welsh slate industry was essentially a Welsh-speaking industry.</a>
