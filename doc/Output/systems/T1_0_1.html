<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>From the Early to the Late Pleistocene, a prehistoric species of Black Vulture, Coragyps occidentalis, known as the Pleistocene Black Vulture or – somewhat in error – the "Western Black Vulture", occurred across the present species' range.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Fossil (or subfossil) Black Vultures cannot necessarily be attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The Black Vulture is a fairly large bird of prey, measuring 56–74 cm (22–29 in) in length, with a 1.33–1.67 m (52–66 in) wingspan.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A leucistic Coragyps atratus brasiliensis was observed in Piñas, Ecuador in 2005.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It soars high while searching for food, holding its wings horizontally when gliding.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Black Vulture also occasionally feeds on livestock or deer.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Black Vultures have sometimes been seen to pick ticks off resting Capybaras.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The Black Vulture is considered a threat by cattle ranchers due to its predation on newborn cattle.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The Black Vulture can be held in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act only allows this in the case of animals which are injured or unable to return to the wild.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.</a>
