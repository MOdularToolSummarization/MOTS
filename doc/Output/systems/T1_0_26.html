<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The narrow and relatively thin main ring is the brightest part of Jupiter's ring system.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In back-scattered light[b] the situation is different.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In February–March 2007 New Horizons spacecraft conducted a deep search for new small moons inside the main ring.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Spectra of the main ring obtained by the HST, Keck, Galileo and Cassini have shown that particles forming it are red, i.e. their albedo is higher at longer wavelengths.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Analysis of available phase and spectral data leads to a conclusion that the size distribution of small particles in the main ring obeys a power law</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>where n(r) dr is a number of particles with radii between r and r + dr and is a normalizing parameter chosen to match the known total light flux from the ring.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Origin and age</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The dust is constantly being removed from the main ring by a combination of Poynting–Robertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The optical properties of the halo ring can be explained by the hypothesis that it comprises only dust with particle sizes less than 15 μm.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In 2002–2003 Galileo spacecraft had two passes through the gossamer rings.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>However some properties have so far gone unexplained, like the Thebe Extension, which may be due to unseen bodies outside Thebe's orbit, and structures visible in the back-scattered light.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The small moon S/2000 J 11, 4 kilometres in diameter, had gone missing since its discovery in 2000.</a>
