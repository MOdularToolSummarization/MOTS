<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>axonomy and naming</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>What is now recognized as a single morphologically variable taxon named Galerina marginata was once split into five distinct species.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Another species analysed in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, also could not be distinguished from G. marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the fourth edition (1986) of Singer's comprehensive classification of the Agaricales, G. marginata is the type species of Galerina section Naucoriopsis, a subdivision first defined by French mycologist Robert Kühner in 1935.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The specific epithet marginata is derived from the Latin word for "margin" or "edge", while autumnalis means "of the autumn".</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The cap reaches 1.7 to 4 cm (0.67 to 1.6 in) in diameter.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The gills are typically narrow and crowded together, with a broadly adnate to nearly decurrent attachment to the stem and convex edges.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The spores measure 8–10 by 5–6 µm, and are slightly inequilateral in profile view, and egg-shaped in face view.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Another potential edible lookalike is the "velvet foot", Flammulina velutipes.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Habitat and distribution</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Galerina marginata is a saprobic fungus, obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Galerina marginata is widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, found in North America, Europe, Japan, Iran, continental Asia, and the Caucasus.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The toxins found in Galerina marginata are known as amatoxins.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Galerina marginata was shown in various studies to contain the amatoxins α-amanitin and γ-amanitin, first as G. venenata, then as G. marginata and G. autumnalis.</a>
